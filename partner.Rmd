## Knitting hw1.Rmd
I was unable to knit hw1.Rmd in this repo because the file pg_mlnxtdcd_072616.png was not included in the repo.

So next time we should make sure that all files used by the R markdown files are included in the repo.

## Errors / Difficulty
Murat had an issue at first pushing his code to his git repository where he got some kind of weird error message,
but all he had to do was enter his username and password and it was fine.
